### Hi there, I am Jingwei Li ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ As a driven data science student pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at Duke, I have experience utilizing Python, SQL, and data visualization tools to derive insights. I am eager to further refine my interdisciplinary data analytics and AI skills. I am passionate about developing innovative solutions to address pressing real-world problems by combining AI techniques. Previously, I interned at GE, where I provided data analysis and visualization support to various business lines. I am a quick learner and adept at mastering new technologies.
